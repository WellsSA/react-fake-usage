# React Fake Usage

This is a simple repository to show what problem react solves by demonstrating (in a fake way) how web was before and what web is nowadays.

This is part of a bigger presentation that can be found here: [Workshop ReactJS: From the beginning to the code challenges and interviews](https://slides.com/wellssa/workshop-react-testes-tecnicos).

> Wells note: This presentation is in Brazilian Portuguese, as it was originally used across different Universities in Brazil to teach students.
